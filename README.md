# Solar System

A simple yet captivating Solar System animation built with React.js. This project represents a true time-scaled version of the solar system, where every object revolves relative to an Earth year.

üåç **Live Demo:** [Solar System](https://solarrsystem.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Time-scaled animation**: Each planet's revolution is scaled to real Earth years (1 year = 30 seconds).
- **Dynamic starfield**: A randomized starfield using Font Awesome icons for a beautiful cosmic background.
- **CSS animations**: Smooth and fluid planet orbits and star twinkles using keyframe animations.
- **Inspiration**: A creative twist inspired by [Malik Dellidj](https://codepen.io/kowlor/) on CodePen.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/solarsystem.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the project:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. The project will run locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customization

You can adjust the speed of planet revolutions by changing the `--year-in-second` variable in the `SolarSystem.css` file:

```css
:root {
    --year-in-second: 30s; /* 1 Earth year = 30 sec */
}

```
Feel free to play around with this value to speed up or slow down the revolutions.
